Dancing in the streets| Cornell 77, fox theater, dicks picks 20 11/28/1976 (pre wonky Jerry tone),
Dicks picks vol. 04| this is the one that got me hooked on dicks picks after looking up a best of the best on reddit. Honestly I got give this whole show a listen because it's a really good one,
Dicks picks vol. 08| awesome acoustic set to start with a nice Cumberland blues. The second set starts with cryptical envelopment and has a nice early dancing in the streets with a tighten up jam that Bobby was pushing for a while before he got it. The electric sets vocals are pretty rough,
Dicks Picks vol. 14| This ones got a nice "They love each other" that's a wee bit speedier and casual with the lyrics then normal, with some mesmerising guitar licks that loop for the verses then get a wee bit jammy in between,
Dicks picks vol. 15| Solid they love each other out of Keith godchaux, lots of hearty piano. Followed by a quick and tight Me and my uncle. Missippi half step has some solid chromatic scales from Keith on piano during the jam, he's been hot on this picks so far. Very full sound with lots of little chromatic runs. Looks like rain comes after with Jerry rockin a crunchier then normal tone and not chicken pickin as much, nice slow wailing solos.,
Dicks picks vol. 16 Fillmore west, 11/08/69 | Overall themes in this show is a younger dead with a bluesier sound. Jerry's vocals are fantastic, as is his playing although it sits a bit back in the mix for some songs. Being that this early double drummer days we get some really distinct sound out of it, early on they're loose and the drums sound full as hell as they are just barely off sync making the beats sound a bit longer. It starts with two good pigpen blues songs: good morning little school girl, and easy wind. He's got all his soul being poured into these ones and it sounds fuckin great. This one's got a speedy China -> Rider in it which everyone seems to be going off on. Dark star (1) brings in a feelin groovy jam toward the end before moving flawlessly into the other one,
Dicks picks vol. 18 05/02/1978-05/03/1978 Diane County colliseum Madison, WI| great show for Donna, her voice is nice and full and is usually complimenting Bobby on his tunes. Her looks like rain and passenger are solidest so far. This is also a great show for Phil in the mix, he's got a a beautiful thick bright tone to his bass that really shines on the music never stopped. This is my first time hearing passenger and it's a sweet song. Deal is quality on this one with Keith playing all sorts of chromatic runs and powerful chords, Donna hits a high mote at the end that's a beaut too. This the music never stopped is probably my favorite version and it's what got me hooked on the Dead (shout out Huber) with their tight comeback after a jam at the end of the song. Phil is amazing on this with driving bass line that's not too in your face. Estimated prophet - > eyes of the world is tasty as hell on this one. Writing this afterward so don't remember other specifics but it was all good from then on,
Dicks picks vol. 19| starts off with a promised land consisting of only Keith, drums and Bobby's vocals in the mix. Very different sounding but my God drums are tight af. Sugaree picks Jerry up in the mix, as well as Bobby's guitar which has a beautiful warm tone and is hand in hand with ketihs piano. Jack straws got a really good clear mix, and the drums sound so crisp and tight. Quality soundboard this show all around, very different and clear versus warm and muddy, barely sounds like any bleeding between the instruments. They love each other has a nice chicken picked loop riff Goin on with Jerry, and Keith keeps it moving and funky. We get a beaut of a play in in the band with patented Donna screams, but they roll right into I know you rider bass line jam led by Phil into a quick feelin groovy at 7:30 into China cat sunflower,
Dicks picks vol. 20, live at capitol center 11/25/1976| first time hearing the song Cassidy and it was a gooden. Got a good pre weird effects pedal dancing in the streets with a clean Jerry tone instead and some good chicken pickin. Sugar mags is a wild one on this, some really good jammin headed by Jerry with a beaut of an outro. Ovwrn now and let it grow are both the standard solid selves, friend of the devil on this is a long one. Everything else in between this and eyes of the world is solid but no stand outs that I remember.(drums -> eyes of the world -> orange tango jam -> dancing) The transition of drums -> eyes of the world is clean as hell with some really good fills, and then the pace is set and they tear on a fast paced jazzy eyes jam where Phil and Jerry just trade solos. Phil is rocking a very full warm bass tone and he just runs all over on this one. Eyes makes its way into organge tango jam which the band lays down a melody and let's Jerry go on, and he does.,
Dicks picks vol. 22, kings Beach bowl 02/23/1968 - 02/24/1968| this ones a young dead having an absolute go. It starts off with a hell of a viola Lee blues. (dark star -> China cat - the eleven -> love light) Dark star picks up into China cat sunflower where Jerry goes off and Bobby pulls the weight in the background, lots of good jammin In this. Got a good lil schoolgirl in here as is standard for pig. (alligator 1 -> China cat 2 -> the eleven 2 -> alligator 2 -> caution) what a fuckin run here, this shows got a lot of young jammin that doesn't seem to stop. We also hit a mountain jam (first there is a mountain) on alligator (2), Jerry has a go on this and it's solid, this must have been shortly after the jam with Duane at the Fillmore.,
Dicks picks vol. 23| jack straws got some hot momentum and Jerry's feelin it on this one, bands tight as hell all around.,
Dicks picks vol. 24| 03/23/1974 cal city, CA cow palace. Starts with a US blues where Bobby's guitar tone is beautifully warm abd for once primarily dominant. Sounds likethe hollow body. Follows up with some super clear vocals on promised land with a more even but still guitar heavy mix. Tight drums on this on, can already tell its gonna be a good mix. Scarlett begonias has a nice stop and go pace to it that the band locks in quick. Donna had been struggling before but beat it on down the line she picks it up. Deals a solid one thrur and thru as was Cassidy, nothing to remember tho. (China cat -> feelin groovy -> I know you rider) China cat picks up and goes into a beaut of a feelin groovy jam where Jerry's tone finally shines through. Everything on this song is a production success,
Dicks picks vol. 25| starts with a good jack straw that the whole band locks in early. They love each other has Phil playing a bit differently then normal with some stand out parts, ramble on rose and Cassidy next and all are solid as well. (me and my uncle -> big river) This leads into a chicken picken four on the floor me and my uncle. Jerry's just going fuckin nuts on this with some lightning blues licks. Let it grow comes in very abruptly and plays good as ever, nothing special tho. This takes us into deal which is a bit slower then normal but still brings quite a bit of heat. The outro is nice and fun, donna and Bobby get a wee bit silly hittin some highs and lows (highest ive heard Donna get). Estimated prophet has the greatest count in I've ever heard from baby, followed up by a crystal clear near album rendition recording, with Donna joining in with some great accompanying vocals. Prophet peels into a nice long jam that runs into eyes of the world where Jerry runs off quick and has some fun while the band speeds up behind him. The drums are just right in the groove and everyone has their time to shine. Sugar mags takes me away, a bit mellow to start but the band just layers on. In the pre sunshine daydream jam Phil breaks through with some great chords. Scarlett fire is killer on this one with what I'm pretty sure is a Bobby solo on the tail end with the clear guitar tone (not the wah). Bobby also starts going wild on the outro too, gets donna and Jerry goofy too all good fun,
Dicks picks vol. 28| this is a long one with some clean cuts but I wasn't too good at taking notes this time around. nice China rider where Bobby takes off in the middle with one of the cleanest tones I've heard from him. The other one turns into a long dissonant jam but has some good stuff in the beginning. Eyes of the world turns into a long dreamy jerry jam at the end.,
Dicks picks vol. 29; Lakeland Civiv Center Arena, Lakeland, FA; 05/21/1977 | 6 hours of dick pickin on this one. Getting to this late, so I guess passenger was pretty tight lol. Has a wonderful Estimated prophet -> He's gone transition that is damn near seamless. Also has a nice 4 on the floor me and my uncle, ends with a nice minor note key change and Phil bomb. This might be my favorite due to both: the ridiculousness of a disco cowboy jam, and it actually sounds tight as hell,
Dicks picks vol. 30| this one starts with a run of 6 songs featuring bo diddly which is sick. This concert also has Keith on keys and pigpen in organ and harmonica, which is cool. China rider on this one really has some speed to it once they get into the bridge jam, Phil lays the bass line down heavy and the band goes nuts on top. Rider picks up with the speedy rider drums (a La Veneta iirc). Going down the road feeling bad hits a nice freight train top speed jam kinda deal, good stuff. Phil drops some really heavy Phil bombs in there too. We got this followed up by ship of fools which was new to me. Not bad but not anything special. Loose Lucy came next which was also new and I'm a big fan of this one, made my weekly playlist,
Dicks picks vol. 31| 08/04/1974 - 08/06/1974 Philly civic center and jersey city Roosevelt stadium. This one starts out strong with a really long one more Saturday night inot a nice Scarlett begonias. This eases into a me and Bobby Mcgee Janis Joplin cover followed by a China rider. Bobby's hot on the China end of China rider, he's feelin it good, feelin so good he pulls out a nice feelin groovy Jame and then decides when he wants into I know you rider and goes for it hard with a good following from the band. Good ol Bobby really took charge on this one. Casey Jones sees Keith and Phil lay down an extremely casual and very different beat. They slow it down and keep it as a slow roller with lots of fun little flourishes. One more Saturday nights not bad but a more chill version. Eyes sounds sweet with some kinda electric piano or weird pedal from Jerry in this one, got a cool wonky sound to it tho. Phil breaks out a beautiful chromatic solo around 7-8mins, and it might be the best of his,
Dicks picks vol. 33 10/09/1976 - 10/10/1976 oaklan coliseum, Oakland, ca| has a good looks like rain in the front end,
Dicks Picks vol. 34 11/05/1977 Community War Memorial, Rochester, NY.| Mississippi half step on this one is real good, they go into a beautiful chromatic up and down thing in the middle, first jam. This continues into the usual calm outro of half step.,
Dicks picks vol. 35 Convention Hall, San Diego, CA 08/07/1971| pigpen hits a nice hard to handle in here, which is the first I've heard that from the dead. It's a real casual bluesy jam that rolls right along with some subtle power to it. Got a nice quick speedy china rider in here as well, the transition into rider are smooth, quick, and full. Sounding real lush. One to skip a few and we're at brown eyed woman, which is slowed way down and takes the casual vibe similar to a speedy rider where everyone is locked in, good stuff. St Stephen picks up with a bright and center Phil. We get an interesting other one (1) with some more good Phil, and then this rolls into me and my uncle which is fucking sick. At the end of the spacey jam Bobby pulls out the me and my uncle intro chords a few times then Jerry rips the scale to start a few time before they all come in, real pretty and subtle. Other one (2) picks up right after with a hell of a teased intro, Phil and Jerry tease that aggressive other one intro before just letting it go into a jam. Morning dew is absolutely beautiful on this with a full band effort and the cleanest mid-high neck phil tone I've ever heard with a few sour chords tossed in for good measure. Pigpens wailing on the organ in the background and is right in sync with bobby, and Jerry and Phil are riding the train. This closes out with a mean as hell morning dewh and then finishes off with one of the finest lovelights I've heard so far. Pigpen is absolutely fired up and gives what-might-be a bit too sexually charged speech in the middle of it, but my god this man is feeling his blues. This magnificent 25 minute song ends with Bobby coming in at 20ish minutes with backing vocals and turns into a howl off with pig which just put the biggest smile on my face I'm cheesin rn, this was a quality dicks picks all right :),
Dicks Picks vol. 36 (the final one) Spectrum Philadelphia, PA 09/21/1972 & last 3 from Folsom Field Boulder, CO, 09/03/1972| Writing this in hindsight for the first half, but I do believe the China -> Rider is pretty solid here. Overall the harmonies between the instruments are pretty tight on this one. (dark star -> morning dew) We have a nuts 37 minute dark star that rolls into a morning dew that rips through you. We also got a Fade away -> goin down the road. We have a fast pace electric friend of the devil for once which is real nice. We also have a sugar mags where bobby misses the second line and just scraps the verse, and it is absolutely hilarious. It all closes out with a crazy another one that's 28 mins long with some absolutely beautiful jams. You can tell the band was locked and loaded on this one.,
Europe '72 Vol. 2 Wembley Empire Pool, Wembley, England; 04/08/1972| Starts off with a decent pace bertha. We make our way into a solid as always rendition of me and my uncle. This heads our way into a fantastic version of Mr. Charlie with some chicken pickin' supreme from Jerry. We see the ever so wonderful yellow dog story with a backing accompaniment while jerry fixes a broken string. Beat it on down the line has keith raggin on the keys and jerry jumpin all over the place, we also get a nice 12 strum start, but I didn't hear bobby ask anyone this time. Aboot midway we get an incredible nearly 12 minute truckin that they just keep jammin on. Dark Star -> Mind Left Body -> Sugar Mags -> Caution needless to say this is one hell of a stretch here, the mind left body into sugar mags is something beautiful watching the band come in one at a time. Bobby starts it off with some very quiet runs and louder root chords, Phil picks up on this, followed by Mickey and all the while Jerry's jamming and everyone comes in at once for the transition to mags. Sugar mags ends with an intense sunshine daydream jam, in which phil drops a couple Phil bombs and then immediately starts that walking bassline and Jerry pounces on it. Pig puts his heart and soul into the few lines of this song but that my god was he made for the blues.,
Europe '72 Vol. 3 Live @ City Hall, Newcastle, England| Jerry rips on Mr Charlie, Solid pig show, china rider,Can't remember much of the first ones but Big Boss Man and Beat it on down the line are both shining spots for our friend pigpen. Beat it on down the line has him laying some really playful organ harmonies that sounds just right as Bobby would say. Brown Eyed women is harmonic greatness from the whole band, pigs settin the tone, while phil plays brightly, Bobby's tone is beautiful on this one. Big railroad blues picks up after a nice lap steel guitar looks like rain from jer. Pigpen takes off in Good lovin with some sweet call and response between Phil and the guitars just before the last vocal verse comes in. We pick up with a ramble on rose that has a nice Jerry classic in up and down pickin like the they love each other on DP 28. Since Jerry's busy with the rhythmic picking, Bobby brings some great accompaniment.,
Europe '72 Vol. 4 Live @ Tivoli Concert Hall, Copenhagen Denmark, 04/14/1972| Starts off with what might be the warmest, butteriest tone I've ever heard out of Phil for a hell of a Bertha. First rambling rose. Feelin groovy jam at 22 min mark of Darkstar. One hell of a Goin down the road feelin bad, the whole bands in it for the 2nd part, drums are tight as hell, organs soulful, and harmonies are just happy as hell. This rolls into another big not fade away that turns into a Bobby pigpen duet on the fade aways to roll it out. Closes with a classic Europe 72 one more Saturday night in which Phil is just a rhythmic freight train with that steady half notes. Caution sees pigpen pull out some bo diddly as he rattles off the first verse of who do you love with some absolute soul, so tell me child who do you love,
Europe '72 vol. 5 | starting this at Mr Charlie which is a quick one but tight and jerry has quick licks. This rolls into one hell of a beat it on down the line where Keith then takes off, he lays down his usual chromatic goodness. Following this is a China rider that starts with a bit of a strange backing drum pattern. Cumberland blues comes in with real lethargic vocals, but an otherwise entirely clean performance. Not gonna lie I think I might prefer the lethargic vocals with the rhythmic intensity in the background, after the second verse they take off with everyone putting all they can forward but it melts into a nice big rhythmic freight train. We get a surprising the other one > me and my uncle > the other one but my God what a me and my uncle, Phil's on fire to start. but I really like this version,
Europe '72 vol. 6 Tivoli Concert Hall, Copenhagen, Denmark 04/17/1972| Jack straw sees something unique in Bobby taking over Jerry's verses, it sound skinda weird at first. He'll of a Casey Jones, pig harmonizes herrys lyrics and the vibrato sounds great. In trucking we get Bobby missing the first few lines of a verse, followed by a whole band freight train jam. Everyone's on it and just pushing further and further. (Next up is Dark Star -> Sugar Mags -> CAUTION -> Johnny b goodeThis gets us into 30 min dark star, opens slow and develops into some kinda jam I didn't know but sounded familiar (not sure if I've heard the same jam before or the quoted song). They come in for harmony at 17ish minutes and Phil teases feelin groovy jam at 17:36.5. He's also been teasing notes of sugar mags throughout (one at 17:56, 20:21, 20:43), which I checked and was indeed next. Keith teases it with chords at times as well. We roll into a very spacey jam where Jerry goes frantic, then teases high notes while the band plays sour notes around him (Even pig digs in at points), Phils rippin chords the whole time. They ease their last jam into a easy feelin jerry solo, and bobby picks up Sugar mags where Jerry can fall right in. Just after 2:00 it sounds like the drummers trade crashes (but the top part) for a wonderful long ringing halfbeat between the two of them. Phil pushes for a CAUTION at the end of sugar mags, but goes a bit too quick while Bobby lets us out on a soft note. Phil then picks it right back up, and Jerry has hopped on the train. Soon enough everyone else is ready to go and steam is pouring out. Jerry hits with a quick break, then the band eases back in.,
Europe '72 vol. 7 - live @ beat club, West Berlin, DE| this is available as a video on beat clubs YouTube. Sugaree in this is just about the cleanest I've ever heard out of the dead, might have been the studio setting but it's great. Playing in the band is yet another clean one with some sweet Jerry slides at one point. They throw in beat it on down the line as they only have 6 mins of tape and it's a shorty. Band lays the rhythm and jerry dances on top the whole time.,
Europe '72 vol. 8 | starts with a standard jammy truckin. At the very end of Tennessee jed Bobby says "you may be wondering why we take so long between songs, it's cuz we're grossly inefficient" jerry says "gives us time to scratch our ass" crowdresponds with a golf clap lmao. We get a wild China rider with a weird drumbeat (weird sharp drop snare?) that's got the bpm pumped up. Pretty sure Keith gets nice solo in here where he lays down some rag. Ends with a whole band Phil bomb kinda thing queued by a Bobby "yeah!". The vocal harmonies are peak dead on this one. This is a good China rider,
11/22/1972| - this shows tapes aren't the best but the mix is really Bobby and Phil heavy and Phil certainly shines on this one,
